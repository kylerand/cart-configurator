## Distribution Checklist

Share with teams:
- [ ] CONFIGURATOR_INPUT_TEMPLATE.md (the form)
- [ ] CONFIGURATOR_QUICKSTART.md (instructions)
- [ ] CONFIGURATOR_EXAMPLES.md (reference)
- [ ] This overview document
- [ ] Contact info for questions

## Key Points to Emphasize

### To Sales Team 👔
- Focus on customer-facing descriptions
- Define popular configurations
- Explain common combinations
- Provide market pricing

### To Engineering Team 🔧
- Focus on technical constraints
- Define physical compatibility
- Specify installation requirements
- Estimate build times

### To Production 🏭
- Provide realistic labor hours
- Define build complexity
- Specify lead times
- Note capacity constraints

### To Finance 💰
- Validate all pricing
- Define discount structure
- Set payment terms
- Approve margins

---

## Common Concerns Addressed

### "This seems like a lot of work"
- **Response:** We only need 10-15 core options to launch. Full catalog can be added over time. Start with your bestsellers.

### "We don't have exact prices yet"
- **Response:** Ballpark estimates are fine for Phase 1. We need relative pricing (X costs more than Y) to build the system. Exact pricing can be updated anytime.

### "What if we offer custom options?"
- **Response:** Define the standard templates. Custom work is handled during quote review, not in the configurator.

### "Our rules are complicated"
- **Response:** Start with the obvious ones (can't have two roofs). Edge cases can be added incrementally.

### "How accurate do labor hours need to be?"
- **Response:** ±30 minutes is fine. We're building quotes, not scheduling. Round to nearest 0.5 hours.

## Success Metrics

**Good data collection means:**
- ✅ 10-15 core options fully defined
- ✅ Basic color palette (5-10 colors per zone)
- ✅ Key compatibility rules documented
- ✅ Pricing within ±10% of actual
- ✅ Labor estimates within ±20%
- ✅ No obvious conflicts or gaps

**Perfect is the enemy of done. Launch with good data, refine over time.**

## After Data Collection

Once you submit completed templates:

1. **Tech team imports data** (3-5 days)
   - Creates seed data files
   - Validates all rules
   - Sets up pricing engine

2. **Internal testing** (1 week)
   - Build test configurations
   - Verify calculations
   - Check rule enforcement

3. **Soft launch** (2 weeks)
   - Internal use only
   - Sales team tests
   - Gather feedback

4. **Full launch**
   - Customer access
   - Marketing rollout
   - Ongoing refinement

- Read the Quick Start Guide
- Review Examples for reference
- Ask questions early

**While working:**
- Use "TBD" or "ASK [person]" for unknowns
- Flag special cases in notes
- Don't guess on critical data

**During review:**
